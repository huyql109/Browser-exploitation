_ check the commit hash -> no memory cage (hooray)
_ kinda typer jit bug -> hard to trigger
_ after trigger the bug, we kinda have oob access (read/write)

Exploit path:
- we need an oob array, a victim array
- abuse oob access from oob array to overwrite length of victim array -> after that, normal browser exploit
